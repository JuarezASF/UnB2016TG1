# step 00 - Render 3d cylinders connecting points in given order

The objective here is to get started.

I've tried messing around with OpenGL, but found the process rather
low level. Because I really wanted to show something done on our
Tuesday meeting, I decided to use a higher level library. I've read 
about a few and settled to use PCL as recommended by doctor Vidal.
It sure was easy, but I don't know if I can make it iterative
enough to use with a tracking algorithm.
